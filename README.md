# ðŸ’« Resume Revamper âœ¨

Revamp your resume with Claude 3 Sonnet managing micro-level decisions (word choice, grammar) so that you can focus on the big picture (content, appeal)

### Environment Setup

Open a new terminal and navigate to the cloned repository's directory. If you are on Windows, run `activate.bat` in your command line, else run `source activate.bat`. Once that command finishes, you can run `activate.bat` or `source activate.sh` every time you reopen the terminal to run a python file in this project.

If your IDE supports automatic sourcing of environments, you can add the created `.venv` file to your environments so that your IDE sources it on open.

Finally, create a file in the base directory named `.env`, register an OpenAI/Anthropic API key, and add the two lines `OPENAI_API_KEY="key_here"` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="key_here"`, replacing `key_here` with your respective keys.

Once this is done, you should be all set up!
